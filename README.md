Geckoboard engineering team occasionally have [brown bag talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-bag_seminar).
At the event, an engineer shares an experience from recent work and we discuss on/off the topic afterwards.
It's usually happened in a Friday afternoon with 20 - 30 minute talk and 10 - 20 minute chat/discussion.

We open the door to our neighbour software engineer friends because it's always fun to get different views from various angles.
Come along if you are intrigued by the topic.

Although the door is opened to everyone, we don't prepare more than we used to do internally.
We want to keep our brown bag as casual as before and effortless without a pressure.
We don't order pizza or provide beer for you so bring your own brown bag.
